Pp# Define the philosophical question

# Define the weighted effects
effects = {
    'happiness': 3,
    'fulfillment': 2,

# Define the algorithm

    # Initialize a variable to store the weighted effects
    weighted_effects = 0

    # Loop over the effects
    for effect in effects:

        weighted_effect = effects[effect] * effect

        # Add the weighted effect to the total
